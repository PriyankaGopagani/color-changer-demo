# Color Changer — with Hex Display

This simple web app lets you change the page color and always displays the current hex color code prominently on screen. You can:
- Generate a random color
- Pick a color using the native color picker
- Enter a hex color manually (#RRGGBB or #RGB)
- Copy the displayed hex code to your clipboard

The hex code display updates live and adjusts its contrast for readability against any background.
